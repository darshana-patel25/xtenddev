At 50 years old, he had lost everything in his business and was left with no other option but to start again. This difficult period gave him a stark realization: he would need another 20 healthy years to rebuild his life.<\/p><p>Inspired by the concept of extending life for better years, he channeled his efforts and research into developing a health supplement that could transform lives—his included. The result was Total Balance, a product that became the cornerstone of Xtendlife.<\/p><p>This passion for the benefits of holistic health led him to formally establish Xtendlife in 1998—a mission that has driven the company for more than 25 years and counting. Xtendlife has grown into a global brand, trusted by over 400,000 customers. Now our team has taken the original vision and will carry on, building Xtendlife for the future. Our commitment to science ensures that our formulas deliver the best results to our customers, helping them live longer and healthier.<\/p>",
