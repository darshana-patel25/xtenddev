        "description": "<p>Not all fish oils are created equal. Xtend-Life uses natural triglyceride oils that have superior bioavailability. Let’s take a closer look at that.<\/p><p>When we consume seafood, the omega 3s are in their natural form, called triglycerides. In contrast, when most manufacturers purify and concentrate fish oils, the oil is converted to a form called ethyl esters. This is needed for the distillation process, which requires high heat.<\/p><p>The problem with ethyl esters is that they are poorly absorbed by the body. One study showed that the maximum level of omega 3 (DHA and EPA) in the blood was<br\/>about 50% lower with ethyl esters compared to triglycerides. Fish oils in the ethyl ester form are the most common type of supplements because they are less expensive to produce.<\/p><p>Some fish oil manufacturers take another step (called trans-esterification) to turn the ethyl esters back to triglycerides. But there is a catch! In re-creating the triglyceride in this way, the molecule ends up in a different chemical structure compared to the natural form.<\/p><p>When it comes to fish oils, we believe nature knows best! That’s why we only use oil in their NATURAL TRIGLYCERIDE form. To manufacture our purified, concentrated fish oils and maintain their NATURAL TRIGLYCERIDE form requires a propriety enzymatic step that is technically difficult and also expensive.<\/p><p>Xtend-Life’s omega blend contains two fish oils which contain NATURAL TRIGLYCERIDES (DHA and EPA), with no conversion to ethyl esters. That makes Xtend-Life’s omega 3 products far superior to most other fish oil supplements on the market, so you can be confident you are getting the most effective type of fish oil available.<\/p>"

Sadly, heavy metals and other contaminants are part of the ocean ecosystem, and therefore the seafood we consume also contains low levels of contaminants.<\/p><p>Rest assured, Xtend-Life’s fish oils are a safe way to get the health benefits of DHA and EPA. Fish oils are purified by a process called molecular distillation, which is highly effective at removing contaminants. International bodies such as GOED (Global Organisation for EPA and DHA) have set limits for contaminants in fish oils.<\/p>"

Measurements such as anisidine value and peroxide value are often used, but these change over time and are not meaningful on their own.<\/p><p>The only truly meaningful measurement of freshness is called TOTOX. TOTOX is a calculation based on both anisidine value and peroxide value. Xtend-Life has set a stringent level of TOTOX which is a lot lower (fresher) than that set by GOED. We test for TOTOX in every batch to ensure complete freshness.<\/p><p>As a consumer, how do you know if your fish oil supplement is fresh? The best thing to do is try it! Fresh oils that have low levels of oxidation have a mild oceanic flavour and aroma. On the other hand, heavily oxidised (rancid) fish oils have a very strong, unpleasant ‘fishy’ taste.<br\/>We welcome you to cut open your soft gel. We guarantee you’ll be pleasantly surprised!<\/p>"
